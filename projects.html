          <h2>Made ads for a show</h2>
          <p>
            I have recently been making some marketing things for a business show. These include a
            <strong>shell scheme</strong>,
            <strong>quarter-page advert</strong>,
            <strong>brochure</strong>,
            and
            <strong>business cards</strong>,
            all with a consistent visual style.

          <h2>Overhauled a website</h2>
          <p>
            I recently overhauled the front-facing pages of a website that gets about 60 unique users a day. I used
            <strong>Bootstrap</strong>,
            so naturally, it is mobile-first and fully responsive.
          </p>
          <p>I laid out the whole site, made up all the images, and coded it.</p>

          <h2>Rewrote a Ruby DSL</h2>
          <p>
            Not long ago I rewrote a gem that implemented a Ruby <strong>DSL</strong>. The DSL is used within Rails controllers to generate form-based views quickly and easily.</p>
          </p>
          <p>The gem may not have been an original thought of mine, but I learned a couple of things about metaprogramming.</p>

          <h2>Made an e-commerce site</h2>
          <p>
            At university, I made an e-commerce site using 
            <strong>HTML</strong> and
            <strong>CSS</strong> (obviously),
            <strong>PHP</strong>,
            <strong>JavaScript</strong>,
            and
            <strong>MySQL</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The website allowed you to order custom greetings cards. You could pick from a number of designs, and then personalise the inside using an interactive JavaScript WYSIWYG editor that I made.

            Made
            <a href = "http://www.exsomnia.co.uk/" target = "_blank">this</a>
            website (a while ago)
          </h2>
          <p>
            I made this site in the summer after my first year at university. It's very basic but does use some
            <strong>AJAX</strong>
            ("past productions" page),
            and the 
            <strong>Google Maps API</strong>
            ("where" page).
