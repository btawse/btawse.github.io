          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>My web development experience comes from my last position as a Junior Software Developer / Business Analyst, and from four modules in computer science that I took while studying at the University of Nottingham: Programming (C), Computer Systems Architecture (theory, and some ARM assembly), Object-Oriented Programming (Java), and Web Programming and Scripting (PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL).</p>
          <p>I have a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy from King's College London (with a grade of 2:1). My philosophy degree has taught me a number of transferrable skills, from reading dense material, to making critical analysis and formulating logically coherent arguments. I studied a wide range of philosophical topics, from ancient Greek philosophy to formal logic.</p>

          <h2>Interests</h2>
          <p>My main interests are cycling and playing music. I have twice taken part in the Paris to Hayling charity cycle ride in the last few years, which is a 5-day, 400-mile cycle through France every summer. I play drums, guitar, and sometimes trumpet and piano, and have been in a number of bands, playing modern rock music as well as classic rock and blues.</p>
